1. **We will not ship garbage.** All the code should be tested before we ship it!
2. **Stable Productivity**
    * We will not allow our project to become unstable in productivity. We know that the system has become unstable when every task becomes more complicated and takes more time.
    * The phrase “This system needs to be redesigned” is an admission of failure, we don’t want a new system that does exactly the same as the old one”.
3. **Inexpensive Adaptability.** Software should be easy to change, that should be the first priority. A system that works but can’t be changed becomes obsolete. A system that doesn’t work but can be easily changed, can be easily fixed.
4. **Continuous Improvement.** Everything should get better with time.
5. **Fearless Competence.** Don’t be afraid to change the code. Testing allows you to make fearless changes.
6. **QA will find nothing!** We will make sure the code is tested before it reaches QA, to speed up this process.
7. **We cover for each other.** We will behave like a team, we have to work together and code with each other. In case someone can’t work another can take over.
8. We follow [80/20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) meaning that 80% of users will benefit from 20% of features.
9. We follow KISS and YAGNI
10. We do not optimize something prematurely
