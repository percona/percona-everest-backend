## Welcome to Percona Everest Backend

Percona Everest is an open source Database-as-a-Service solution that automates day-one and day-two operations for Postgres, MySQL, and MongoDB databases within Kubernetes clusters.

## Prerequisites

Publicly accessible Kubernetes cluster ready to use. We do not provide guidance or solutions for spinning up Kubernetes clusters.

## Creating Kubernetes cluster

You need to have a publicly accessible Kubernetes cluster to try Everest. You can go with EKS, GKE. You might find it challenging to make it work using local installations of Kubernetes like minikube, kind, k3d or similar products.  Everest does not help you to spin-up Kubernetes cluster but it helps you to install all required components for Everest to run.


## Getting started 

Percona Everest has two main components that help you set up the environment:

1. [CLI](https://github.com/percona/percona-everest-cli) implements the installation of required components for Everest to work
2. Backend that implements DBaaS features

You can start playing with Everest using the following way

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/percona-everest-backend/main/quickstart.yml
docker-compose -f quickstart.yml up -d
```
It will spin up the backend/frontend that will be accessible on the http://127.0.0.1:8080 address



**Everest provisioning**

To install all required operators in the headless mode you can run these commands

```
git clone git@github.com:percona/percona-everest-cli
cd percona-everest-cli
go run cmd/everest/main.go install operators --backup.enable=false --everest.endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:8080 --monitoring.enable=false --name=minikube --operator.mongodb=true --operator.postgresql=true --operator.xtradb-cluster=true --skip-wizard
```
Alternatively, use wizard to run it:

```
âœ— go run cmd/everest/main.go install operators
? Everest URL http://127.0.0.1:8080
? Choose your Kubernetes Cluster name k3d-everest-dev
? Do you want to enable monitoring? No
? Do you want to enable backups? No
? What operators do you want to install? MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
```
Once provisioning is complete, you can visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to create your first database cluster!```

## Known limitations

1. It supports only the basic creation of database clusters without monitoring integration and backup/restore support. We will add this support soon
2. It supports only one Kubernetes cluster on the user interface, however registering multiple Kubernetes clusters is possible.
3. No authentication/Access control features. You can configure it with the existing authentication solution you're using 
    * [Ambassador](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador) via
  [auth service](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/services/auth-service)
    * [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io) via the
  [External Authorization HTTP Filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/security/ext_authz_filter.html)
    * AWS API Gateway via
  [Custom Authorizers](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/compute/introducing-custom-authorizers-in-amazon-api-gateway/)
    * [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com) via
  [Authentication Based on Subrequest Result](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-subrequest-authentication/)
